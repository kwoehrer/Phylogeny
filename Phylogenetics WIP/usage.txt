How to use:
1. Create an inputFile.txt
	a. Format for input file is as follows
		(integer for number of species) (integer for number of traits in all species)
		(Species 1 String Name) 0 1 0 1 0 1 
		(Species 2 String Name) 1 0 1 0 1 0
		...
		(Species n String name) 1 1 1 1 1 1
	b. Possible common errors creating the input file:
		-Having a space after integer on first line
		-Species not all having the same number of traits
		-Not enough species are present
		-Too many species are present
2. Run the MainMethod CLI(Command line interface)
	a. Proper usage is java MainMethod inputFile.txt
	b. Follow prompts on the command line.
	c. If there are a large number of traits/species, then it is recommended to just perform UPGMA tree creation and not to show parsimony
3. Access the outputFile.txt
	a. Should be present in the directory in which you accessed the CLI
